Through Amalara Game Studio, I design, write, and publish table-top role-playing games and the systems that power them. I focus on producing games that reward creativity, heroism, and teamwork, even though some of them are supposed to be scary and most can be played solo.

Amalara Game Studio supports diversity, equality, and inclusion in all of its company spaces. Racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist, ableist, or fascist behavior won't be tolerated.
