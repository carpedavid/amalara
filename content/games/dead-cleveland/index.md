In `Dead Cleveland`, you play as one of the few humans who has managed to survive the month following a zombie apocalypse. You left your old home and banded together with your fellow survivors to create a new home in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Each survivor plays a role in keeping your settlement functional, and your role, either by yourself or with a team, is to venture into the city in search of essential supplies and friendly survivors.
