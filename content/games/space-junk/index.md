*A role-playing game about angry aliens, salvaged space tech, and the limitless wonders of the cosmos.*

Space Junk is a storytelling game about a far future version of our universe where galactic empires have fallen and reclamation companies, pirate guilds, and mobsters fight for control of a war-torn sector of the galaxy. To play it, you will adopt a persona called a `character` through whose eyes you will experience this story vicariously.

In the story you create, you play a newly licensed salvager who scours Null Space for wrecked spacecraft, ruined cities, abandoned settlements, and anything else you can sell to the Big Six salvage companies. Along the way, you’ll fight bad guys, solve mysteries, rescue stranded travelers, and occasionally marvel at the wonders of the cosmos.

## What you need to play

To play Space Junk, you’ll need the following in either analogue or digital form:

- An active imagination, a desire to be creative, an interest in science fiction, and a place where you can focus.
- A journal, blank paper, and copies of the record sheets at the end of this book.
- A handful of six-sided dice (abbreviated `d6`).

## Player's Guide

You can currently get the art-light, beta version of the Space Junk Player’s Guide. The guide contains all of the rules and lore you need to start your own game of Space Junk. It will be updated alongside the full version of the game, which will contain a starting campaign and a robust set of tools to procedurally generate your own version of Null Space.

The Player’s Guide will remain free forever while the full version will be a paid game upon release.

## What you get

- The full game in PDF, including the rules, a starter campaign, and tools to generate your own version of Null Space.
- PDFs of the character, ship, and space record sheets.
