***When you die, you are given a choice.** The first option is to continue on to the Afterworld and experience What Comes Next. The second option is to remain in this world, become a guardian spirit, and watch over your family. Being a guardian is thankless — the living have no idea you exist. Most spirits choose to move on. You, however, chose to stay.*

In this solo, narrative game, you play a guardian spirit who is charged with watching over a family member. You'll use your newly acquired spirit powers to influence events in order to protect, encourage, and inspire your charge at various points throughout their life. The ultra-light VRBS system emphasizes taking creative risks and places the focus squarely on the story.
