*Your only child has been taken by goblins to the underground city of Ix, where they mine coal and tend to the great clockwork contraptions that run your perfect world.*

*You want to remember their name. You want to hold them in your arms, again. You want to bring them home.*

Journey into the Underground by yourself or with a team to find your child in this short TTRPG of steampunk and urban fantasy. Explore a steam-powered world filled with goblins, monstrous clockwork gears, and endless spiral staircases.

Underground is a Push-powered game published using the [Push SRD](https://capacle.itch.io/push). The rules-light, narrative-forward Push system features a single conflict-resolution mechanic, GM-less play, and zero prep-design.
