If you like zombies, survival horror games, and...er...Cleveland, then you'll love [DEAD CLEVELAND](/games/dead-cleveland)!

In Dead Cleveland, you play as one of the few humans who has managed to survive the month following a zombie apocalypse. You left your old home and banded together with your fellow survivors to create a new home in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Each survivor plays a role in keeping your settlement functional, and your role, either by yourself or with a team, is to venture into the city in search of essential supplies and friendly survivors.

Dead Cleveland is built on the VRBS system, an ultra-light game of cinematic action that is perfect for zero-prep, GM-agnostic adventures for both solo and team play. The 24 page, A5 PDF contains 4 pages of easy-to-master rules and 20 pages of post-apocalyptic zombie goodness.
