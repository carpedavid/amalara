A long time ago, I founded Amalara Game Studio to publish the [Land of the Crane](/posts/lotc/) campaign setting. Eventually, publishing the work of other authors and game designers became more work than I could handle, and I closed the project down. Now, however, I've found my way back to game design, and I'm taking a much more measured approach. I'm going to publish my work at my own pace. Some of it will be free. Some of it I'll charge for, mostly to recoup investment in artwork, technology, or other materials. But I'm doing this now because it's a creative outlet that I find wildly fulfilling.

So follow along. I hope you'll find something to enjoy!
