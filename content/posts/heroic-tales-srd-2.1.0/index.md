Version 2.1.0 of the Heroic Tales SRD is now available! This is the single biggest update to the Heroic Tales system to date, restructuring the core rules to make it easier for game designers, hackers, and homebrewers to create their own games. The new SRD contains 38 pages of game design goodness organized into core rules, optional rule add-ons, and tips for using the rules to construct a heroic-themed game.

You can download it directly from [itch.io](https://carpedavid.itch.io/heroic-tales).
